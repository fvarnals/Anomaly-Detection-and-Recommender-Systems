# Anomaly-Detection-and-Recommender-Systems



#### <em>Application of the anomaly detection algorithm and use of collaborative filtering to build a recommender system for movies.</em><br>
  
##### In the first half of this exercise, we implement an anomaly detection algorithm to detect anomalous behavior in server computers.

##### In the second half of the exercise we implement the collaborative filtering learning algorithm and apply it to a dataset of movie ratings

Files that I had to write code to:<br>
<strong><em>estimateGaussian.m</em></strong> - Estimate the parameters of a Gaussian distribution with a diagonal covariance matrix<br>
<strong><em>selectThreshold.m</em></strong> - Find a threshold for anomaly detection<br>
<strong><em>cofiCostFunc.m</em></strong> - Implement the cost function for collaborative filtering<br>
